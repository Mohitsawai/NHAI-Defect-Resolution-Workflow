The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) employs a structured defect resolution workflow, heavily relying on the NHAI One App for digital monitoring and compliance, particularly for projects under its performance assessment system.While the precise, multi-step internal process can vary based on the contract type (EPC, BOT, HAM) and policy circulars, the core workflow generally follows these stages:Core Defect Resolution WorkflowStageKey ActivitiesResponsible Parties & Tools1. Defect Identification & ReportingProject Directors (PDs), Authority Engineers (AEs), and Independent Engineers (IEs) frequently inspect the highway. They identify defects (potholes, cracking, signage issues, etc.) and upload them onto a centralized platform. Inspections are often mandated more frequently, especially during the monsoon season.Project Directors (PDs), AEs/IEs (Consultants), NHAI One App (for digital logging).2. Digital Logging and MonitoringDefects are digitally notified and logged on the NHAI One App. The system monitors over 95 types of highway defects. Data is used to track the status of rectification and forms a part of the concessionaire's performance assessment.NHAI One App, NHAI Data Lake.3. Rectification/Remedial ActionThe concerned Concessionaire or Contractor is responsible for undertaking prompt repairs and rectification of the logged defects. The goal is to address the issues within the stipulated time as per the contract's operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements.Concessionaire/Contractor.4. Verification of RectificationThe PDs, AEs, or IEs conduct re-inspections to verify the rectification status of the reported defects. They confirm if the defects have been satisfactorily resolved according to the prescribed standards and log the closure in the system.Project Directors (PDs), AEs/IEs.5. Performance Assessment & ComplianceThe compliance with defect rectification is formally assessed as part of the Performance Assessment Rating System for Concessionaires. Non-compliance can lead to administrative action and a lower rating.NHAI (through a dedicated team and system).Key Mechanism: NHAI One App & Rating SystemThe workflow is strongly enforced through a Performance Assessment Rating System for Concessionaires, where Defect Rectification Compliance on the NHAI One App is a significant component (20% weightage) alongside the Pavement Condition Index (PCI - 80% weightage).NHAI One App: This mobile application is the primary tool for digitizing the defect management process, allowing for real-time monitoring and tracking of over 95 defects.Compliance: Concessionaires with a rating value less than 70 out of 100 (non-performers) face consequences, including being ineligible to secure new NHAI projects until their rating improves, thereby incentivizing the timely and effective resolution of defects.Associated Process: Dispute ResolutionIf a major issue or defect-related claim results in a contractual disagreement between NHAI and the Concessionaire/Contractor, it enters the Dispute Resolution Process.Dispute Resolution Board (DRB): Disputes are first referred to the DRB.Conciliation: If dissatisfied with the DRB's decision, the dispute proceeds to mandatory conciliation through the Conciliation Committee of Independent Experts (CCIE).Arbitration: If conciliation fails, the dispute may proceed to arbitration, which is governed by the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
